<h1 style="color:Olive;text-align:center;font-family:Britannic Bold;"><u>HAJJ:FIFTH PILLAR OF ISLAM</u></h1>
<h2 style="color:Olive;"><u>Introduction:</u></h2>
<p>The Hajj, in Islam, the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, which every adult Muslim must make at least once in his or her lifetime if he/she can afford it. The Hajj is the fifth of the fundamental Muslim practices and institutions known as the Five Pillars of Islam. The pilgrimage rite begins on the 7th day of<b> Dhū al-Ḥijjah</b> and ends on the 12th day.<p>

<h2><u>Purification of the soul:</u></h2>
<p>Hajj is believed to purify the soul and bring one closer to Allah. The rituals of Hajj involve a series of acts of worship, including prayers and fasting. By performing these acts, Muslims seek to strengthen their faith and devotion to Allah. Hajj is also an opportunity for Muslims to seek forgiveness for their sins and make a fresh start in their lives. The experience of Hajj is transformative, and Muslims often return home feeling renewed and spiritually refreshed.</p>

<h2><u>Unity:</u></h2>
<p>Hajj is a reminder of the universal community of the Muslim Ummah. People from all over the world, regardless of their race, ethnicity, social status or gender, gather in Makkah to perform the same rituals. Hajj is a time for Muslims to come together and celebrate their shared faith and values. The experience of Hajj fosters a sense of unity and solidarity among Muslims, reinforcing the importance of <b>compassion, cooperation and mutual respect.</b></p>

<h2><u>Commemoration of Prophet Ibrahim and Prophet Muhammad(PBUH):</u></h2>
<p>Hajj is a commemoration of the lives and teachings of <b>Prophet Ibrahim (AS)</b> and<b> Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)</b>. <b>Prophet Ibrahim (AS)</b> is considered the father of all prophets in Islam and is revered for his faith and devotion to God. The rituals of Hajj, such as the sacrifice of an animal, are a reminder of Prophet <b>Ibrahim's (AS)</b> willingness to sacrifice his son <b>Ismail (AS)</b> in obedience to Allah. Hajj also commemorates <b>Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH)</b> performance of the pilgrimage and serves as a testament to his leadership and guidance for Muslims.</p>

<h2><u>Renewal of Faith:</u></h2>
<p>Hajj is usually a once-in-a-lifetime experience for most Muslims and is considered a great honour to perform. Many who perform Hajj return home with a renewed sense of purpose and a deeper understanding of their faith. The experience of Hajj is a reminder that life is a journey, and that the ultimate goal is to seek <b>Allah's pleasure, guidance and forgiveness.</b></p>
